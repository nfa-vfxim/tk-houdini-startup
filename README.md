# tk-houdini-startup
tk-houdini-startup is a Shotgun Toolkit app that allows you to add some logic to the startup process of [tk-houdini](https://github.com/nfa-vfxim/tk-houdini). At default, the app sets the frame range of your Houdini session to 1001-1240. This and other things can be configured through your Shotgun Configuration.
